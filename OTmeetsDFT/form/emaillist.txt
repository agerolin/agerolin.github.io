Luca Nenna		 Université Paris-Dauphine and Inria-Paris	 Ceremade	 luca.nenna@gmail.com	 30/05/17	 08/06/17	  Numerical Methods for Multi-Marginal Optimal Transportation	 In this talk we aim at giving a general numerical framework to approximate solutions to optimal transport (OT) problems. The general idea is to introduce an entropic regularization of the initial problems. The regularized problem corresponds to the minimization of a relative entropy with respect a given reference measure. Indeed, this is equivalent to find the projection of the joint coupling with respect the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This allows us to make use the Bregman/Dykstra’s algorithm and solve several variational problems related to OT. We are especially interested in solving multi-marginal optimal transport problems (MMOT) arising in Quantum Physics (e.g. Density Functional Theory). In this cases we show that the entropic regularization plays a more important role than a simple numerical stabilization.

More specifically, we focus on the system of one electron interacting with one photon mode through the minimal coupling prescription in dipole approximation. In the minimal coupling prescription except from the interaction between the electron and the photon mode, there exists a self-interaction term for the electron. We discuss the importance of this self-interaction, which is a harmonic oscillator interaction, and we show that without this self-interaction our system becomes unbounded from below. In the last part of our poster presentation we show how we can introduce such a system in the framework of density-functional theory.	 
Faizan Nazar		 Université Paris-Dauphine	 CEREMADE	 nazar@ceremade.dauphine.fr	 2017-05-30	 2017-06-07	  Locality of Electronic Structure Models	 I will give an overview of locality results for electronic structure models and discuss their applications in materials simulations. These include the construction of QM/MM coupling methods and linear scaling algorithms.

I will also introduce a lattice relaxation problem, which considers the rearrangement of a crystal lattice after the introduction of a defect as a variational problem. This treats both point defects and dislocations. Our main result establishes the far-field decay of minimising lattice displacements, which applies to several electronic structure models including: Tight-Binding and DFT models, such as the restricted Hartree-Fock Yukawa model and a Thomas-Fermi type model with full Coulomb interaction.

I will try to provide some insight into the delicate dependence of the uniqueness and structure of solutions on the cost function, a phenomenon which is largely absent in the classical, two marginal problem.  Examples of costs for which the solution is always unique and of Monge type will be contrasted with those (including the Coulomb cost from DFT) which do not exhibit this beaviour.

The theoretical layout of a fully rigorous density-potential mapping in time-dependent quantum mechanics is scrutinized further in this talk. The two main ingredients for a supposed contraction mapping leading to a fixed point representing the unique external potential belonging to a given density are two inequalities. One is a bound for the inverse of a Sturm-Liouville operator and the other an estimate for the internal forces term with respect to the potential. At this stage the different pieces of the fixed-point scheme are brought into contact and one sees if they fit (spoiler alert: they don't). We want to hightlight such issues and also describe possible ways to avoid them from the beginning.	 Vegetarian
Michael Ruggenthaler		 Max-Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter	 Theory	 Michael.Ruggenthaler@gmail.com	 28/05/17	 07/06/17	  The Density-Potential Mapping in Quantum Dynamics II: Structures	 We will present a fixed-point approach to the density-potential mapping in time-dependent quantum mechanics. This approach is based on the continuity and the local force equation of quantum mechanics. First we will present under which conditions on the initial states and the external potentials these equations are well-defined. In a next step we will invert this equation, for which we need to show that a certain Sturm-Liouville operator is invertible. This will give us conditions on the allowed densities and boundary conditions and allows us to set up an iterative sequence that for a given time-dependent density should converge to the corresponding external potential. In our quest to guarantee that this iterative sequence converges, we show that the internal forces are functionally differentiable or at least Lipschitz continuous with respect to the external potentials. Implications are discussed.

This allows us to compute any property as a functional of the initial state and density, including the exact Hxc potential, and hence provides a powerful new tool to investigate the fundamental aspects of TDDFT. Additionally, it also provides multiple new density-based ways to do quantum control, complementing the usual potential-based methods. For example, it lets us do optimal control, but where we search over a set of densities instead of a set of potentials. This is mainly useful in the special cases where the objectives can be expressed in terms of the density only, in which case we can first simply find the optimal density, and then use our method, or when we can restrict the search to a small set of densities. Finally, the successful implementation reveals some interesting aspects of how to rigorously implement the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, which are not very well known.

In systems out of equilibrium, we reverse engineer the true independent-particle potential and bias which reproduces the density and current of an interacting and disordered system. Such potentials can then be used to gain insight into how to non-ambiguously interpret interacting and disordered systems using single-particle potentials. We find that interactions always smoothen the effective disordered energy landscape. The increased smoothness do not always, however, lead to an increase in the current, due to strong interaction effects. We interpret the interplay between disorder and interaction, in an independent-particle picture, by a competition between the smoothness of the effective energy landscape and the reduced effective bias.

We consider an analytically solvable model of two interacting electrons that allows for the calculation of the exact exchange-correlation kernel of time-dependent density functional theory. This kernel, as well as the corresponding density response function, is studied in the limit of large repulsive interactions between the electrons and we give analytical results for these quantities as an asymptotic expansion in powers of the square root of the interaction strength. We find that in the strong interaction limit the three leading terms in the expansion of the kernel act instantaneously while memory terms only appear in the next orders. We further derive an alternative expansion for the kernel in the strong interaction limit on the basis of the theory developed in [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 18, 21092 (2016)] using the formalism of strictly correlated electrons in the adiabatic approximation. We find that the first two leading terms in this series, corresponding to the strictly correlated limit and its zero-point vibration correction, coincide with the two leading terms of the exact expansion. We finally analyze the spatial non-locality of these terms and the limitations of the adiabatic approximation. The ability to reproduce exact quantities in the strong interaction limit indicates that the adiabatic strictly correlated electron formalism is a useful formalism to study the density response and excitation properties for a wide range of systems with strong electronic interactions.	 
Jonas Lampart		 CNRS &amp; Université de Bourgogne	 ICB	 jonas.lampart@u-bourgogne.fr	 31/05/17	 07/06/17	  The role of interactions in the &quot;Runge-Gross Theorem&quot;	 Time-dependent density functional theory relies on a one-to-one correspondence between external potentials in the N-particle Schrödinger equation and the one-particle densities they generate.
Runge and Gross argued that this correspondence holds (up to a time-dependent constant in the potential) for sufficiently &quot;nice&quot; external potentials. 
I will discuss a mathematical setting for this argument an explain when it can be made fully rigorous.  The interaction potentials play an important role for this and I will discuss the problems that arise in the presence of singular interactions, like the Coulomb potential.
