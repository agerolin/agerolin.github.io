			Our list of interesting research ideas to explore (in the waiting list because of our limited time) is growing exponentially. For this reason, Master & Bachelor Projects in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science are always available. Feel free to make an appointment with any of the staff members to discuss the different possibilities, which span from more formal 'pen&paper' projects to programming and testing new ideas. Check our <a href="research.html">Research Team</a> page for possible projects, and do not hesitate to propose your own ideas for discussion.<br><br>
				
			We are also looking to highly motivated students and postdocs to join our team and work on the development of Machine Learning methods for Scientific discovery. For more information about research oportunities and informal enquires please contact directly the professor you would like to work with.<br><br> 
			
			<h5>PhD positions</h5>
				
			Several PhD positions are available at the University of Ottawa for candidate interested in developing Artificial Intelligence methods at the interface of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Medicine. We strongly encourage highly motivated students in mathematics, quantum physics, computer sciences, engineering, theoretical and computational chemistry to contact us to discuss project possibilities. Exceptional undergraduate students can be admitted directly to a PhD program.<br><br>
				
			<blockquote>
					 Candidates are invited to apply by email via the address <a href="mailto:AI4Science@uottawa.ca">AI4Science@uottawa.ca</a> with subject <b>“PhD Quantum 2022”</b>, <b>“PhD Math 2022”</b> or <b>“PhD Chemistry 2022”</b>. The application package should include the following documents as attachment in a single pdf file:<br>
					 <br>
					 1) <b>CV</b>;<br>
					 2) <b>Motivation letter</b> explain why you want to earn a Ph.D. at AI4Science @uOttawa;<br>
