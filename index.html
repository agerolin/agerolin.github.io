						<p class="subtitle"> Diversity Axioms </p>
						<blockquote>
							We do agree with the diversity axioms of <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/" target="_new">Federico Ardila</a> (and extended it to Science):<br>
							<u>Axiom 1</u>. Mathematical (Scientific) talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.<br>
							<u>Axiom 2.</u> Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical (scientific) experiences.<br>
							<u>Axiom 3.</u> Mathematics (Sciences) is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.<br>
							<u>Axiom 4.</u> Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
