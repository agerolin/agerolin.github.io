<p class=subtitle> PhD position 1: Calculus of Variations and Optimization</p>
					
					<blockquote>
Candidates are expected to have experience or interest in conducting research on mathematical and/or computational aspects of optimal transport.  Possible topics include regularized Optimal Transport, gradient flows in the space of probability measures, mean-field games, multi-marginal optimal transport and applications in Machine Learning (e.g., Generative Models, Neural ODEs, etc).<br><br>
						
					Depending on the profile and interest of the candidate, research visits at industrial partners can be scheduled as well as develop part of the PhD at one of our academic collaborators in the Netherlands, Italy, Finland, Germany or United States.<br><br>
					
The selected PhD candidates will receive training in mathematics and scientific computing as well as perform their PhD research in a highly collaborative environment, under the supervision of Prof. Gerolin. The starting date of the PhD is expected to be between July and October 2022.<br><br>
						
Candidates are invited to apply by email via the address <a href="mailto:CRCAIMathChe@uottawa.ca">CRCAIMathChe@uottawa.ca</a>. The email, with subject “PhD 1 Application” should include the following documents as attachments in a single pdf file:<br><br>

1) <b>CV</b> with (possibly) list of publications;<br>

2) Evaluations of <b>university exams</b>;<br>

3) <b>Current and future study project</b>, including for instance a short description of the master thesis and research directions (max 3 pages);<br>

4) <b>A list of at most three referees</b>, willing to write a letter of recommendation.<br><br>

A few candidates will then be requested to ask their referees to send a recommendation letter directly to Prof. Gerolin and will be invited for an online interview.<br><br>

Applications will be evaluated <b>starting from April 5th</b>. The open position will remain open until the appropriate candidate is hired.
