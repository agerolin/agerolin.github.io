<p class=subtitle> PhD position 1:   Optimal Transport and applications&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
					
<blockquote>
	Candidates are expected to have experience or interest in conducting research on mathematical, computational aspects of optimal transport.  Possible topics include regularized Optimal Transport, gradient flows in the space of probability measures, mean-field games, multi-marginal optimal transport and applications in Machine Learning (e.g., Generative Models, Neural ODEs, etc).<br><br>

	Depending on the profile and interest of the candidate, research visits at industrial partners can be scheduled as well as develop part of the PhD at one of our academic collaborators in the Netherlands, Italy, Finland, Germany or United States.<br><br>

	The selected PhD candidates will receive training in mathematics and scientific computing as well as perform their PhD research in a highly collaborative environment, under the supervision of Prof. Gerolin. The starting date is September 2024.<br><br>

	Interested candidates are invited to send an e-mail at the address <a href="mailto:CRCAIMathChe@uottawa.ca">CRCAIMathChe@uottawa.ca</a>. The email, with subject “PhD 1 Application 2024” should include the following documents as attachments in a single pdf file:<br><br>

	1) <b>CV</b> with (possibly) list of publications;<br>

	2) Evaluations of <b>university exams</b>;<br>

	3) <b>Current and future study project</b>, including for instance a short description of the master thesis and research directions (max 3 pages);<br>

	4) <b>A list of at most three referees</b>, willing to write a letter of recommendation.<br><br>

	A few candidates will then be requested to ask their referees to send a recommendation letter directly to Prof. Gerolin and will be invited for an online interview.<br><br>


	Applications will be evaluated on a first-come, first-served basis until December 31st 2023. The official application must be send directly to the University of Ottawa via the <a href="https://www.ouac.on.ca/apply/ottawagrad/en_CA/user/login" target="_blank">Ontario Universities Application centre</a> before February 1st.<br /><br />
