					<p class="para">    <p>In our Magnetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_(mathematics)" title="A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely. When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position." target="_new">pendulum</a> a metallic ball X is attached on a string, which is fixed on a pivot (top of pendulum base). Additionally, three magnets - denoted by R, G and B - are placed on the pendulum base in the bottom in such a way they form an equilateral triangle.  <br><br>

If we start the pendulum at various initial positions (out of its equilibrium position), it will swing according to the net force produced by the gravity and the magnetic attraction.  <br><br>

Due to friction and induced currents, pendulum will lose steadily its kinetic energy as it swings and the swinging will slow down. The mass of the ball X is designed light enough so that in the end X will converge on the vicinity of one of the magnets, i.e., the magnetic force dominates over the gravity. <br><br>

function myFunction() {
    var myWindow = window.open("magneticpendulumpopup.html", "", "width=1000,height=500,left=0,top=0,toolbar=No,location=No,scrollbars=no,status=No,resizable=no,fullscreen=No');  NewWindow.focus(); void(0);");
}
</script>
Feel free to play with our magnetic pendulum (or its <a onClick="myFunction()" style="cursor: pointer; cursor: hand;"> virtual version</a>). You will notice that depending on the initial position of the ball, it may end on top of different magnets. In fact, unless we start in immediate vicinity of one of the magnets, the tiniest change of the initial position of the pendulum can cause the ball X to take a totally different path and end on top of a different magnet. <br><br>

We are interested in the following <b>question</b>: <br>

<em>Given an initial position for the ball, can one predict on which magnets its going to end up?</em><br><br>

If you make more experiments and observe them more carefully, you get the intuition that we understand and can predict the movement of the pendulum in the next few seconds the ball is left from its initial position. Instead, it can be very hard to predict the trajectory for longer times and even to guess on which of the magnets R, G or B the ball may end up. <br><Br>
